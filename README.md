# SSTEX  
Convert simplified text into valid LaTeX code.  

## Overview  
Writing in LaTeX gives professional results, but its syntax can be verbose and difficult to memorize. **sstex** removes this barrier by letting you write in a simplified, human-readable text format and automatically converting it into valid LaTeX code.  

Instead of remembering dozens of LaTeX commands, you write with minimal markup (similar to Markdown), and `sstex` expands it into the correct LaTeX syntax. This makes it easier to:  
- Draft documents quickly.  
- Focus on content instead of formatting.  
- Learn LaTeX gradually without being overwhelmed.  

## Features  
- Simple syntax â†’ clean LaTeX output.  
- Handles sections, lists, and formatting.  
- Lightweight, portable, no external dependencies.  
- Designed for quick drafting and prototyping of LaTeX documents.
